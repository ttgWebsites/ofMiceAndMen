					<li data-theme="d">When the novel opens the narrator is describing a beautiful river located in a wooded area in rural California.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Their is a path leading to the river, and along it two men walk, Lennie and George.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The two men are wearing outfits fitting of farmhands and one man, Lennie, is significantly larger than the other.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The two men stop to rest by the river and the larger man bends down for a drink of water.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">George, the smaller man, warns Lennie to not drink too much so he does not become sick like the previous night.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Through their conversation it becomes clear to the reader that Lennie suffers from some minor mental disabilities.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">During the conversation George spends much of it complaining, as the two were headed to a farm where they are planning on working, however the bus driver dropped them off many miles from their destination.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Suddenly George stops talking as he notices Lennie is holding a dead mouse.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Lennie had just wanted to pet it, but accidentally killed it.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">George scolds Lennie and tells him that on the new farm he must behave himself accordingly, unlike the last experience in Weed.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The two decide to settle down for the evening and make camp.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">While George is not paying attention Lennie sneaks off to find the dead mouse, only to be caught by George again.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">After this the reader learns that Lennie has somewhat of an obsession with soft things, as his Aunt Clara had allowed him to pet mice when she took care of him.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Lennie however often killed the small animals he was petting, as he was not aware of his own strength.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">George takes a moment to complain about Lennie and lament about how life would be much easier without him.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He cites the experience in Weed, where Lennie was stroking a girl's soft dress and would not let go.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">People assumed that he was assaulting her, and the two were run out of town.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">George is embarrassed by his outburst and apologizes to Lennie; he then goes on to tell Lennie the story of their future plans.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">They dream of saving enough money to buy their own plot of land where they can farm it, keep animals, and settle down and enjoy life.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Before they fall asleep George tells Lennie that if they run into any trouble on the new farm that they should meet up in the clearing where they are currently camping out.</li>
				</ul>

					<li data-theme="b">Section 2</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The two men finally arrive at the farm the next morning and meet Candy, another ranch-hand, who is described as an aging man who is missing one hand.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Candy shows them to their quarters, which are in a bunkhouse where all the other ranch-hands live.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The bunkhouse is small and cramped but Lennie and George make due.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Candy then tells them that the boss of the ranch was upset they did not arrive the previous night, however for the most part he appears to be a nice guy.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Eventually the boss arrives to meet the men and immediately begins to question them about their late arrival and their farm skills.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">George begins to do all the talking and explains that the bus let them off in the wrong place; he then begins to speak on their skills, however Lennie buts in and George cuts him off.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It appears to the boss that perhaps George is trying to take advantage of Lennie who seems like he cannot care for himself.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">George explains that they are cousins (a lie) and adds that Lennie was kicked in the head by a horse when they were young, thus causing him to act in such a way.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The boss is not quite convinced, however he lets it slide and assigns them jobs working on the grain teams.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">When the boss leaves George begins to chastise Lennie for speaking, and Candy appears to overhear them.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">George tells Candy to forget what he has heard and mind his own business, which Candy agrees to do.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Candy has a pet dog that follows him around, however it is very old, smelly, and half-blind.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Soon after, the boss' son arrives to meet the men.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The man's name is Curley and he is a smaller man who seems very confrontational.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">After Curley leaves, Candy explains that Curley has become even more confrontational after his recent marriage to a young woman who loves to flirt with the ranch-hands.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Candy leaves to begin his work and George takes a moment to warn Lennie to stay away from Curley and remind him of their meeting place.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">After their brief discussion Curley's wife enters the room, she is very dressed up and wears a lot of makeup.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She begins to flirt with the two men and another ranch-hand, Slim, who passes by.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">She eventually leaves, and Lennie remarks to George that he thinks she is very pretty.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">George is upset about this as he recognizes the possibility of trouble because of Lennie's attraction.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">George demands he stays away from her, and Lennie suddenly becomes upset and wants to leave the farm.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Slim enters the farmhouse and introduces himself.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The reader learns that he is a very talented and respected man on the ranch.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The men are then joined by another, Carlson.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Carlson questions Slim about his dog, which just had puppies.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Slim explains that he had to drown four of them because they could not be fed.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The talk of puppies gets Lennie's hopes up as he longs of having a pet.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The group is interrupted by the sound of a triangle announcing dinner.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Before they can head over for dinner Curley finds them again and asks if they have seen his wife.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">After Curley continues on George explains that he does not like or trust Curley, and he would not be surprised by confrontation.</li>

				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Section 3</li>
					<li data-theme="d">On the first day of work George becomes friends with Slim.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Following the end of work for the day the two head back to the bunkhouse discussing the puppies.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Slim agrees to give one of them to Lennie, as George convinces him that Lennie is a good intentioned person despite his slight mental disability.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Slim comments on how nice it is to see two people, Lennie and George, have such a great friendship.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">George, begging to trust Slim, decides to tell him the story of how he and Lennie became friends.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">George explains that the two are from the same town, and that George only came to care for Lennie when Lennie's Aunt Clara died.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He adds that at first he was abusive and pushed Lennie around, until one day he pushed him to far and Lennie nearly drowned.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Ever since then George began to care for him as a friend, and in doing so he really became close with Lennie.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">George even goes into detail about the last farming experience in Weed where Lennie latched onto a woman's dress because he thought it was soft.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The girl then yelled and called rape on Lennie causing George and him to have to hide out while a lynch mob searched for them.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">After the conversation Lennie, who comes into the bunkhouse hiding a puppy under his jacket, joins the two.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">George immediately chastises him for taking the puppy away from his mother too early and makes him take it back.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Candy and Carlson then enter the bunkhouse arguing about Candy's dog.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Carlson cannot stand the dog and urges Candy to allow him to shoot it and put it out of its misery.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Candy is adamant against this, however Slim steps in and helps convince him that it is a good idea.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Eventually a reluctant Candy gives in and takes the dog outside.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Meanwhile a different farmhand joins the group and shows Slim a magazine article.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The article was written by a former farmhand and published in a pulp magazine.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">While they are speaking a gun shot rings out and Candy is left visibly upset.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Crooks enter the bunkhouse seeking out Slim as he has just tarred a mule's foot and needs Slim.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The two leave and the other men begin a game of cards.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">While they play cards they discuss Curley's wife and they all agree that she's going to be trouble eventually as she is so flirtatious.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Ironically enough, Curley enters the bunkhouse looking for her and when he realizes that she is not there he storms out in Slim's direction as he has new suspicions.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">A few of the men in the bunkhouse immediately follow as they hope to see a fight.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">George stays behind as Lennie has just entered the bunkhouse again and George questions Lennie about Slim and whether he was with Curley's wife.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Lennie says no and George once again warns Lennie about Curley's wife.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He then tries to take Lennie's mind off of it by describing their dream farmhouse, which excited Lennie.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Candy overhears this and offers to help pay for it if he can live there with them.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">George and Lennie gladly agree as that would mean they are only a month or so away from having enough money for a down payment on a plot of land.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The other men begin to return from the barn and the three quit discussing their farm.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Slim enters the bunkhouse with Curley, Carlson, and Whit.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Curley, after realizing he couldn't beat Slim in a fight, apologizes for his suspicions, however he is still extremely upset.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Curley decides to take his anger out on Lennie and attacks him punching him several times before George can convince him to fight back.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Lennie grabs onto Curley's hand and breaks it, causing Curley to cry out in pain and back off.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Slim grabs Curley and takes him away, he then urges him to not fire Lennie and George as he will surely be an embarrassment on the farm if he does.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Lennie is visibly upset after the altercation, and George comforts him.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Lennie fears that he will not be allowed to raise rabbits on their farm now, however George promises him that he will.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Section 4</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The following day all the men except Lennie go into town.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Meanwhile in the harness room, Crooks, the black man who watches the stable, rests in his bunk all alone.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Lennie enters Crooks' quarters but Crooks immediately tells him to leave, as he does not want a white man in his quarters if he is not allowed in the quarters for white men.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Lennie explains that he is all alone and saw Crooks' light on and thought he'd offer him company.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Crooks agrees to let him in and immediately Lennie begins to gush about his plans to buy a farm with George despite George's insistence they keep it secret.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Crooks however thinks this is just a fantasy brought about by Lennie's mental disability.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Crooks, feeling comfortable with Lennie, begins to tell him about his life.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He explains that when he was growing up he lived on a chicken farm with his family and they were the only black family around for miles.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He adds that his father often told him to not befriend any of the white neighbors as nothing good would come from it, and though as a child he did not understand, as an adult it makes perfect sense.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Crooks laments the social standards set for blacks and whites, and in doing so becomes visibly upset.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">In his weak state Crooks begins to scare Lennie by convincing him that George is not returning from town.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Lennie becomes very worried to the point that Crooks gives up the joke and promises that George is fine.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Crooks then goes back to speaking of his childhood, and Lennie back to the dream of the farm.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Crooks then explains that he has seen many a farmhand with the same dream, however the dream is always unrealistic.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Eventually the two are interrupted by Candy who makes his first ever visit to Crooks' quarters.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Candy begins to tell Lennie of how he believes that they can successfully raise rabbits on the farm and Lennie is overjoyed.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Crooks however shoots this down and explains that they will never be able to make it work, however Candy explains that they already have picked out land and are close to having the money.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Crooks suddenly changes course and even asks if he can chip in and join the group.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The three men are then surprised as Curley's wife enters the quarters.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She begins to berate the group as being weak because they were left behind when the other men went to the brothel.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Candy tries to shoe her out of the room, however she continues to go on and begins talking about her miserable life with Curley and her loneliness.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Sensing that she is trying to cause trouble, Candy again tries to get her to leave, however she shifts her focus to Lennie as she has deduced that he got his bruises and Curley his broken hand by the two fighting.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Crooks finally confronts her and tells her to leave, however she hints that she could have him lynched if he were to do anything to suggest she was up to trouble.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Eventually they hear the other men coming and she decides to leave.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">George enters and begins to berate Candy for speaking about the farm in front of other people.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Crooks senses that this is because George would not want him on the farm and immediately recants his desire to join the group.</li>

					<li data-theme="c">Lennie is furious with himself for killing the puppy and with the puppy for dying, as he is afraid George will be upset with him and not allow him to raise rabbits on the farm.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Eventually he realizes that he must face George and tell him the truth as lying would not work; he hopes that George will not care, as the puppy meant nothing to him.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">While he is debating whether or not to tell George, Curley's wife interrupts him.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Lennie quickly hides the puppy as she approaches.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">When she speaks Lennie ignores her at first due to instruction by George, however she tells him that it is okay to talk to her and that the other men will not even know as they are preoccupied with a game of horseshoes.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">She spends the next few minutes lamenting her life and complaining about her failed dreams as she had once dreamed of going to Hollywood, however it fell through and she chose to marry Curley instead.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She begins to gain Lennie's trust after she discovers the puppy and consoles him rather than berate him for killing it.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Eventually Lennie begins to tell her about his dream of raising rabbits causing her to question why he loves animals so much.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Lennie explains that he loves soft things, and Curley's wife offers him the chance to feel her hair.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Out of excitement Lennie latches on to it causing her to cry out in pain.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Lennie then tries to quiet her by grabbing her mouth, however this only makes her scream louder causing Lennie to grab even tighter.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Eventually in an effort to quiet her Lennie accidentally strangles her to death.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Lennie then panics after realizing what he has done, he hides her body, grabs the dead puppy, and flees to the clearing where he would meet George.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Soon after, the men enter the barn and find her dead body.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">George immediately knows what has happened and is devastated, as he knows that Lennie is done for.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Candy explains to George that there is no hope for Lennie, as Curley will surely have him lynched.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He is devastated as he now realizes not only will Lennie's dream of a farm not come true, but his dream as well.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Knowing that Curley will suspect George was in on the murder, he and Candy devise a plan in which Candy will inform the others and George will act shocked.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Eventually Candy brings him to tell the group and immediately Curley demands for Lennie's death.</li>
