					<li data-theme="b">The Predatory Disposition of Human Beings</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Almost every character featured in the novel seems to at one point or another admit that they are extremely lonely and long for a friend.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">They are willing to express their feelings to anyone that will stop and listen.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The only two characters that seem to lack this feeling of loneliness are Lennie and George, as they have each other.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The other characters in the novel that seem to experience loneliness the most seem to show that they would prefer to put down anyone weaker than they are and accept the loneliness.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The best example of this is when Lennie and Crooks are speaking with one another.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Crooks had just spent time speaking about his insecurities and making himself vulnerable, however, soon after this he insults Lennie and puts down Lennie in an effort to make him seem like a stronger man.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It is through this example that the reader sees that despite the feeling of loneliness, it is human nature to put that aside in order to shoot someone else down to build themselves up.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">The Unrealistic American Dream</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Throughout the novel many of the characters confess their dreams and desires for a better life.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Each seems rather outlandish, however the characters cannot seem to let go of them.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Curley's wife tells Lennie of her dream to work in Hollywood, however after many failures she chose to settle down with Curley instead.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Meanwhile both Lennie and George share a dream of buying their own farmland and raising animals and living off the land without taking orders from anyone.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The two even pass the dream on to others on the farm that cling to it with hope that they will someday soon have a better and happier life.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">One character, Crooks, shoots down their dream, as he understands the unrealistic nature of the American dream and the quest for happiness.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Sure enough in the end, every characters dream is ruined in one moment as Lennie accidentally kills Curley's wife thus ruining her dreams as well as his, George's, and Candy's.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The tragic ending goes to show that for the average American the American Dream is nothing more than just a dream.</li>
