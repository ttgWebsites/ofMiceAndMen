					<li data-theme="d">Of Mice and Men is a tragic novel that follows the story of two migrant workers, Lennie and George. 
					The two men roam the land in California going from farm to farm looking for opportunities to work. George is described 
					as a smaller man with striking features, while Lennie is a much larger man who exhibits the traits of minor mental 
					disability and is unaware of his own physical strength. The two have a close relationship as George seems to be the 
					caretaker of Lennie, and Lennie seems to depend on George. The two often dream of a day when they can own their own farm, 
					however George seems to recognize that this is nothing more than a dream. The two find a job on a farm as ranch-hands 
					as George convinces the farm owner that Lennie is a hard worker and lacks social skills because he was kicked by a horse. 
					On the farm the two meet the young wife of the farm owner's son, a pretty woman who is not given a name in the novel.
					Lennie seems to have some sort of attraction to her, however this can only lead to a terrible outcome. One evening 
					while left alone on the farm, Lennie is approached by her. She sees that Lennie is upset and allows him to play with
					her hair to cheer him up, Lennie however is too rough, and accidentally hurts her. Then, in order to quiet her,
					accidentally breaks her neck. Scared, Lennie flees to a place he and George had planned to meet if either of them had trouble.
					Meanwhile the other men return and find that she is dead, they then set out to catch and lynch Lennie. George
					however knows what must have happened, he sets out on his own to find Lennie, and does what must be done, shoots Lennie.</li>
