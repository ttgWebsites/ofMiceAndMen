					<li data-theme="b">How does foreshadowing play a role in the novel?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Foreshadowing is key throughout the novel as it is used from the very beginning to hint at the tragic ending.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In the first section Lennie is seen petting the dead mice, and from early on it is evident that he has an affinity for soft things, however he also cannot control himself physically when it comes to handling these soft things.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">This hints at the tragic death of the puppy that Lennie later receives as well as Curley's wife in which Lennie hurts her when he pets her hair.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Later on in the novel when Lennie is attacked by Curley we see just how strong Lennie is even when it is unintentional as Lennie breaks Curley's hand in the scuffle just by squeezing it.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The most significant use of foreshadowing is the death of Candy's dog.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Candy's dog has become a nuisance and though Candy is attached to it dearly, it is time for it to go, therefore Carlson steps up and puts it down.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The death of the dog is a parallel to Lennie's situation, Lennie becomes a nuisance to George, as well as everyone else due to his mental disability, and ultimately George must take him out as a benefit to himself and the others.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Detail the relationship between Lennie and George.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The entire novel is centered on the relationship between Lennie and George, and throughout it seems both characters are dependent on one another, both for different reasons.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Lennie is slightly mentally disabled and without George he would not be able to get by.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">George is his guide and mentor, and everything Lennie does he does thinking of how it will affect his relationship with George.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">George on the other hand lives a frustrating life caring for his friend, and it is quite obvious life for him would be much easier without Lennie.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">George often berates Lennie and speaks of how much better off he would be without him, however when it comes down to it, despite Lennie's neediness George has also become dependent on his friend.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It is clear in the final scenes when George shoots Lennie, that despite the problems Lennie has caused him, killing him is anything but easy.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Their friendship is very unique, as they both shared a common dream and care about each other more than themselves.</li>
